My [friend](https://github.com/Blacepos) and I went to our first hackathon, Spartahack 8 on January 28th! We made a really cool app called AutoNote and we even won one of the prizes (Best use of MongoDB)! It was such a fun experience and I learned so much about web development. You can check out our project at https://devpost.com/software/autonote-woigte.
This previous year we went again and made [Re:Flect](https://devpost.com/software/re-flect), which includes an interactable mirror which you can both see yourself and change what you see within the mirror via a phone app!

Any current project I'm working on will most likely be hosted on my AWS server, which you can find here: http://18.191.152.114:8080
