My [friend](https://github.com/Blacepos) and I went to our first hackathon, Spartahack 8 on January 28th! We made a really cool app called AutoNote and we even won one of the prizes (Best use of MongoDB)! It was such a fun experience and I learned so much about web development. You can check out our project at https://devpost.com/software/autonote-woigte.
